# Something (functional)

This repository contains a collection of exercises and code snippets written in various **functional programming languages**, such as [Haskell](https://github.com/haskell), [F#](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp), [OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml) (and possibly others in the future).

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- [``AdventOfCode/``](https://github.com/filipondios/something/tree/main/AdventOfCode2015): Solutions to problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- [``Codewars/``](https://github.com/filipondios/something/tree/main/Codewars): Functional solutions to challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [``Exercism/``](https://github.com/filipondios/something/tree/main/Exercism): Exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
- [``Myfuncs/``](https://github.com/filipondios/something/tree/main/MyFuncs): Personal functions, experiments, and small practice snippets not based on any specific platform

## Purpose

This is simply a repository where I keep my solutions to programming challenges from various problem-solving platforms. I make it available in case anyone is interested in seeing how I approached and solved these problems using functional programming.
